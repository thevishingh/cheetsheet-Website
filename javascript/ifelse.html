                    The "if" statement in JavaScript is used to execute a block of code if a certain condition is met.
                    The "else" clause is used to execute a block of code if the condition is not met.
                </p>
                <p class="titledescription">
                    Here is the basic syntax for an "if" statement:

                <li class="links">
                    <pre class="language-js"><code>if (condition) {

                    <pre class="language-js"><code>if (condition) {

                <p class="titledescription">
                    The condition is a boolean expression that evaluates to either true or false. If the condition is
                    true, the code in the "if" block is executed. If the condition is false, the code in the "else"
                    block is executed (if present).
                    For example:
                </p>
                <li class="links">
                    <pre class="language-js"><code>let x = 10;

                <p class="titledescription">
                    In this example, the condition "x > 5" is true, so the code in the "if" block is executed and the
                    message "x is greater than 5" is printed to the console

                    The "if-else ladder" is a control structure in JavaScript that allows you to execute a different
                    block of code depending on multiple conditions. It is called a ladder because it consists of
                    multiple "if" and "else" statements arranged in a ladder-like fashion.

                <p class="titledescription">
                    In this structure, each "if" statement is followed by an optional "else" statement. If the first
                    "if" condition is true, the code in the corresponding block is executed and the rest of the ladder
                    is skipped. If the first "if" condition is false, the second "if" condition is evaluated, and so on.
                    If none of the conditions are true, the code in the "else" block is executed.
                </p>
                <p class="titledescription">For example:</p>
                <li class="links">

                <p class="titledescription">
                    In this example, the first "if" condition "x > 15" is false, so the second "if" condition "x > 10"
                    is evaluated. This condition is also false, so the third "if" condition "x > 5" is evaluated. This
                    condition is true, so the code in the corresponding block is executed and the message "x is greater
                    than 5 but less than or equal to 10" is printed to the console.

                    The "if-else ladder" is a useful control structure for executing different blocks of code based on
                    multiple conditions. It can help you write more concise and maintainable code in JavaScript.

                <h3 class="listtitle">Switch case</h3>
                <p class="titledescription">The "switch" statement in JavaScript is another control structure that
                    allows you to execute a different block of code depending on a specific value. It is often used as
                    an alternative to the "if-else ladder" when you have multiple conditions to check against a single
                    value.</p>
                <p class="titledescription">
                    Here is the syntax for a "switch" statement:

                <li class="links">
                    <pre class="language-js"><code>switch (expression) {
case value1:
  // code to be executed if expression == value1
  break;
case value2:

...
default:
  // code to be executed if expression does not match any of the values
}</code></pre>
                </li>
                <p class="titledescription">
                    In this structure, the "expression" is evaluated and compared to each of the "case" values. If the
                    "expression" matches a "case" value, the corresponding block of code is executed. The "break"
                    statement is used to exit the "switch" statement and prevent the code in the following cases from
                    being executed. The "default" case is optional and is executed if the "expression" does not match
                    any of the "case" values.

                    let x = "apple";
switch (x) {
case "apple":
console.log("x is an apple");
break;
case "banana":
console.log("x is a banana");

case "orange":
console.log("x is an orange");

default:
console.log("x is something else");

                <p class="titledescription">
                    In this example, the "expression" is the variable "x," which has the value "apple." The "expression"
                    is compared to each of the "case" values, and when it matches the value "apple," the corresponding
                    block of code is executed and the message "x is an apple" is printed to the console.

                <!-- Ternary Operator -->
                <h3 class="listtitle">Ternary Operator</h3>
                <p class="titledescription">
                    The ternary operator is a shorthand way to write an if-else statement in JavaScript. It takes the
                    form of condition ? value1 : value2, where condition is a boolean expression, and value1 and value2
                    are expressions of any type. If condition is true, the ternary operator returns value1; if condition
                    is false, it returns value2.
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                    Here's an example of how you can use the ternary operator to assign a value to a variable based on a
                    condition:
                </p>
                <li class="links">
                    <pre class="language-js"><code>
let x = 10;
let y = 20;
let max;
max = (x > y) ? x : y;
console.log(max); // Outputs: 20</code></pre>
                </li>
                <p class="titledescription">
                    In this example, the ternary operator checks whether x is greater than y. If it is, max is assigned the value of x; otherwise, it is assigned the value of y.
                </p>
                <p class="titledescription">
                    The ternary operator can be a useful and concise way to write simple if-else statements, but it can become difficult to read and understand when used for more complex statements or nested inside other expressions. In these cases, it may be better to use a regular if-else statement instead.
