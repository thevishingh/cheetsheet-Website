            In object-oriented programming, a static method is a method that is
            associated with a class, rather than an instance of the class. In
            JavaScript, static methods are defined using the static keyword and
            they can be accessed without creating an instance of the class.
          </p>
          <p class="titledescription">
            For example, consider the following class MathHelper that defines a
            static method called add() that takes in two numbers and returns
            their sum:
          </p>
          <li class="links">
            <pre class="language-js"><code>
class MathHelper {
    static add(a, b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
</code> </pre>
          </li>
          <p class="titledescription">
            You can access the static method directly from the class, without
            creating an instance of the class.
          </p>
          <li class="links">
            <pre class="language-js"><code>
console.log(MathHelper.add(1, 2)); // 3
</code></pre>
          </li>
          <p class="titledescription">
            Static methods are useful when you want to add utility methods to a
            class that don't depend on the state of an instance. For example,
            you might use a static method to generate a unique ID for an object,
            or to perform a calculation that doesn't depend on the state of an
            instance.
          </p>
          <p class="titledescription">
            It's important to note that static methods do not have access to the
            this keyword, as they are not associated with an instance of the
            class. Instead, they can only access the arguments passed in to the
            method and any variables or functions defined within the class.
          </p>
          <p class="titledescription">
            In conclusion, static methods in JavaScript are methods that are
            associated with a class, rather than an instance of the class. They
            are defined using the static keyword and can be accessed directly
            from the class, without creating an instance of the class. Static
            methods are useful when you want to add utility methods to a class
            that don't depend on the state of an instance. However, it's
            important to keep in mind that static methods do not have access to
            the this keyword.
